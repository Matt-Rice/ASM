Inves�ga�ng JVM Bytecode and the ASM Bytecode Library (100 points)
Project Goal: To investigate Java bytecode and use the ASM bytecode library to write simple
bytecode programs.
Overview: For this project you will write several programs using the ASM library to generate
.class files for several small programming tasks.
Instructions: Write a program for each numbered item below to generate a class file that will
perform that action. In parentheses after each item is the name your .java file should have the
name of the java class it creates.
1. Mul�ply two numbers (I, L, F, and D), store them, and then print each result
(gen1.java,program1.class)
2. Subtract two numbers (I, L, F, and D), store them, and then print each result
(gen2.java,program2.class)
3. Divide two numbers (I, L, F, and D), store them, and then print each result
(gen3.java,program3.class)
4. Compare two numbers (I, S, L) to determine which is bigger and print it
(gen4.java,program4.class)
5. Declare and print String Variables (gen5.java,program5.class)
6. Get input from the user using the Scanner class (I, L, and D) (gen6.java,program6.class)
7. Implement a While Loop (gen7.java,program7.class)
8. Implement If. . . Then . . . Else (gen8.java,program8.class)
9. Get input (I or D), from the user, run a loop that adds that number to an accumulator,
and then print the result. (gen9.java,program9.class)
